# Graph isomorphism colourings problem

The graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic.
It was solved using python. Even when two graphs are isomorphic( mapping of nodes and edges are preserved between 2 structures), it may not be immediately obvious. As the number of nodes increases it is important to keep effivciency in mind and develop a relatively time efficient solution. 

Here this problem was solved using python by colouring each edge and seeing if it matches. In such a way that no two touching edges have the same colour and in a way that the fewest number of colours as possible are availed of. 

So if A is isomorphic to B. func(A≅B) -> true. 
So if A is NOT isomorphic to B. func(A≅B) -> false.
